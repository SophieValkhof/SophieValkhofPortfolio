			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>My name is Sophie Valkhof. </p>
			<p>I am an 18 year old, fresh out of high school CMGT student with a goal to eventually become a systems Designer</p>
			<p>My passion lies within Roguelikes and high skill tactical games, and I hope to help design these someday.</p>
			<p>I am currently working on becoming a self sufficient designer, so that I can slot into any company or role, </p>
			<p>As well as work as an indie developer may the need arise. </p>
			<p>Listed below are some of the projects I have worked on</p>

		<p>On top of the more notable projects mentioned above, my time at CMGT has learned me a lot of valuable skills</p>
		<p>I am using these skills to work on a big solo project: A singleplayer roguelike game that will be released to this site when it in a state of release</p>

		<p>I will be trying to do everything on my own, to practice coding and general design principles, as well as 3D modelling</p>
		<p>This project will be done in Unity, but it may be switched to Unreal if Unity does not work out</p>
